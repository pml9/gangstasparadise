# SkillBridge

## Overview
SkillBridge is an intergenerational skill exchange platform enabling users across all age groups to teach and learn from one another. This platform promotes connection, knowledge transfer, and community building through structured skill-sharing sessions.

## Feature 1: User Profile Management

### 1.1. Profile Creation Screen
**States:**
- **Default:** 
  A clean, minimalist form with ample whitespace and clearly labeled input fields. The screen presents a sequential form with logical groupings of related information: personal details, skills to teach, skills to learn, and preferences. Large, clear typography with varying weights to establish hierarchy. Color accents highlight important fields and interactive elements. Clear progress indicators show where the user is in the multi-step process. Users can upload a profile photo with a circular crop mask and intuitive drag-and-drop functionality. Custom dropdown selectors for age group with subtle animations on expand/collapse. For responsive design, the form maintains columnar layout on larger screens but stacks vertically on mobile devices, with appropriately sized touch targets.

- **Loading:** 
  A subtle loading animation with a pulsing primary color accent provides feedback when form data is being processed. Animation follows physics-based principles with natural easing. Background elements receive a slight opacity reduction to create visual focus on the loading indicator. Loading state clearly communicates system status without causing anxiety. For responsive design, the loading indicator remains centered and appropriately sized across all devices.

- **Error:** 
  Form validation errors appear inline next to relevant fields with a subtle red accent color and descriptive micro-copy explaining the issue. An unobtrusive notification appears at the top of the form summarizing the errors. Error messages use clear, simple language avoiding technical jargon. Field borders transition to error state with smooth animation. For responsive design, error messages remain clearly visible and associated with their respective fields on all screen sizes.

- **Success:** 
  On successful profile creation, a celebratory animation briefly appears with confetti elements in brand accent colors. The screen transitions to a success state showing a summary of the created profile with options to edit or proceed to the dashboard. Success messaging uses positive reinforcement language. For responsive design, the success animation and summary view maintain proportional scaling across devices.

### 1.2. Profile Edit Screen
**States:**
- **Default:** 
  Identical layout to the creation form but pre-populated with the user's existing data. A clear "Save Changes" button appears fixed at the bottom of the screen. Current profile photo is displayed with an overlay edit button on hover/touch. Modified fields are subtly highlighted to indicate changes from original values. For responsive design, the same adaptations as the profile creation screen apply, with the save button remaining accessible at all times.

- **Loading:** 
  Same loading animation as profile creation, applied when saving changes. For responsive design, maintains consistent appearance across devices.

- **Error:** 
  Follows the same error state patterns as profile creation. For responsive design, maintains consistent appearance across devices.

- **Success:** 
  A more subtle success animation than profile creation, with a non-modal toast notification confirming changes were saved. The screen remains on the edit view rather than transitioning away. For responsive design, toast notification appears at the top on mobile and at the top-right corner on desktop.

## Feature 2: Skill Discovery and Matching

### 2.1. Browse Skills Screen
**States:**
- **Default:** 
  A clean grid layout of skill cards with generous whitespace between elements. Each card displays the skill name, instructor's name and age group, proficiency level, and session format (virtual/in-person) using clear iconography. Cards use subtle shadows and hover animations to indicate interactivity. Search and filter controls appear at the top with clear visual hierarchy. Category filters use color-coding with good contrast ratios for accessibility. For responsive design, the grid adjusts from 4 columns on large screens to 2 columns on tablets and a single column on mobile, with appropriately sized touch targets.

- **Loading:** 
  Initial load shows skeleton screens matching the eventual card layout but with animated gradient effects. Progressive loading allows users to interact with already-loaded content while additional items load. For responsive design, skeleton screens match the responsive grid layout of the actual content.

- **Empty State:** 
  When no skills match current filters, a friendly illustration appears with helpful text suggesting filter adjustments. The empty state includes quick-action buttons to reset filters or try suggested alternatives. For responsive design, the illustration scales appropriately with screen size while maintaining legibility of the helper text.

- **Filter Active:** 
  Applied filters are clearly indicated with pill-shaped indicators that can be individually dismissed. Results update with a subtle transition animation, maintaining scroll position when possible. For responsive design, filter indicators stack horizontally on desktop but may shift to a scrollable horizontal row on mobile devices.

### 2.2. Skill Detail Screen
**States:**
- **Default:** 
  A focused view of a single skill offering with prominent instructor details and rich skill information. The layout uses a card-based design with clear sections for different information categories. Availability calendar shows possible session times with intuitive color-coding. Large, accessible "Request Session" CTA button with subtle animation on hover. Skill proficiency visualized with an intuitive graphical element. For responsive design, the layout shifts from a two-column arrangement on desktop to a single scrollable column on mobile, prioritizing the most important information at the top.

- **Loading:** 
  Similar skeleton screen to browse view but focused on single skill layout. For responsive design, matches the eventual content layout for the current device.

- **Error:** 
  If skill details fail to load, an apologetic error message appears with options to go back or retry. Error animation shows a broken connection with friendly illustration. For responsive design, the error state maintains proportional scaling and readability across devices.

## Feature 3: Session Management

### 3.1. Session Request Screen
**States:**
- **Default:** 
  A focused form with clear sections for session format selection (in-person/virtual), date/time selection, and optional notes. Calendar interface uses intuitive date picking with available slots highlighted. Time selection uses a visually distinct dropdown or time picker component. Format selection uses large, accessible toggle buttons with clear iconography. For responsive design, the calendar view adapts to different screen sizes, with a more compact agenda view on mobile devices.

- **Loading:** 
  Subtle loading animation when checking availability or submitting request. For responsive design, loading indicators maintain proper sizing and positioning across devices.

- **Error:** 
  Clear validation errors for missing or invalid selections. Specific error handling for scheduling conflicts or unavailable times. For responsive design, error messages remain clearly associated with their respective fields regardless of screen size.

- **Success:** 
  Confirmation animation and message confirming request has been sent. Summary of requested details with option to add to personal calendar. For responsive design, confirmation details and buttons remain appropriately sized for the current device.

### 3.2. Session Dashboard Screen
**States:**
- **Default:** 
  A clean, organized view of upcoming and past sessions with clear visual distinction between different session statuses. Upcoming sessions prominently display date, time, skill, and participant information with quick-action buttons for managing each session. Sessions are organized chronologically with the next upcoming session highlighted. Color coding helps distinguish between teaching and learning sessions. For responsive design, sessions display as cards in a grid on desktop but stack vertically on mobile, with collapsed information expanding on tap.

- **Empty State:** 
  When no sessions exist, a friendly onboarding illustration guides users toward creating their first session. Quick action buttons for browsing skills or requesting sessions. For responsive design, the illustration and call-to-action buttons scale appropriately for different screen sizes.

- **Loading:** 
  Skeleton screen placeholders for session cards during data fetching. For responsive design, skeleton screens match the eventual layout for the current device.

- **Session Update:** 
  When session status changes (accepted, rescheduled, etc.), a subtle highlight animation draws attention to the updated session. Toast notification confirms the change. For responsive design, notifications remain visible and properly positioned regardless of screen size.

## Feature 4: Feedback and Analytics

### 4.1. Session Feedback Screen
**States:**
- **Default:** 
  A simple, focused feedback form with intuitive rating scales and optional comment fields. Rating controls use both stars and descriptive text with subtle animations on interaction. Large, clear input areas for qualitative feedback with character count indicators. Age-appropriate language based on user's profile. For responsive design, rating controls remain easily tappable on mobile while maintaining their visual clarity. Input areas expand to use available screen space.

- **Loading:** 
  Subtle loading animation when submitting feedback. For responsive design, loading indicator remains properly sized and positioned.

### 4.2. Personal Impact Dashboard
**States:**
- **Default:** 
  A visually rich dashboard with meaningful visualizations of personal impact metrics. Clear information hierarchy highlighting most important metrics first. Data visualizations use accessible color schemes with good contrast. Metrics include skills taught/learned, hours contributed, community impact, and achievement badges. For responsive design, visualizations reflow from a multi-column grid on desktop to a single scrollable column on mobile, with charts resizing to maintain readability.

- **Loading:** 
  Progressive loading of dashboard elements with skeleton screens for charts and metrics. For responsive design, loading placeholders match the eventual content layout.

- **Empty State:** 
  For new users without data, an encouraging onboarding view explains how metrics are generated and suggests first actions. For responsive design, onboarding illustrations and text maintain proper proportions and readability.

- **Filter Active:** 
  When time filters are applied (weekly, monthly, all time), visualizations update with smooth transitions. Filter controls use clear visual hierarchy and selection indicators. For responsive design, filter controls collapse to a dropdown menu on smaller screens to conserve space.
