## MVP Flow

A clear, step-by-step description of the core minimum-viable process:

1. User creates a profile selecting their age group and listing skills they can teach and skills they want to learn
2. User searches/browses for skills they want to learn or people they can teach
3. User sends a session request selecting preferred format (in-person/virtual) and available times
4. Recipient accepts request and confirms session details
5. Session occurs and both parties provide feedback afterward
6. Dashboard updates with new metrics and suggests future exchanges
