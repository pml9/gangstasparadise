Break down age stereotypes

HOW:

Onboarding & Profiles: Select age group; list teach/learn skills; set format (in‑person/virtual), availability, motivation.

Discovery & Matching: Search/filter skill cards; algorithmic recommendations; proximity and rating filters.

Scheduling & Sessions: Calendar integration; session format, duration, materials via a step‑by‑step wizard.

Feedback & Analytics: Intergenerational‑aware ratings; dashboards for personal impact (hours, skills) and community milestones.
