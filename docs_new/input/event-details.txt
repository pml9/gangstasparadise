# The Vibe Coding Rush - where AI meets every part of the product lifecycle.

## General rules, expectations and details about the scoring:
 
### General
Source code is available on the shared GitRepo
Application is publicly accessible
Minimal functional requirements are met
Presentation/demo is prepared
We are going to score following categories
Functionality
Feature Coverage
UX/UI Quality
Documentation
Test Coverage
Project Board Usage
General Vibe - how innovative your approach was
 

### Feature Implementation & Strategy
All teams will receive the same set of high-level features.
Teams must ideate, design, and interpret how to implement these features.
Creativity, planning, and team strategy are key parts of the challenge.
### Scoring System
A live AI-powered scoring system will evaluate:
Functionality
Feature coverage
UI/UX quality
Documentation (README)
Test coverage
Project board usage
Overall “vibe”/approach
Weights (ponderation) for each category will be published before the event (on Thursday).
Teams will see their live scores and can improve during the day (e.g., update README, add tests).
The scoreboard will be public, increasing competitiveness.
### Rules & Technical Guidelines
No login screens – to allow automated scoring; use role selectors if needed.
All submissions must be:
Deployed or accessible via a public URL
Code committed to Git repo
README must describe the features implemented
Presentation and video will not impact core scoring, but serve to showcase work and boost the “vibe” score.
Board usage is encouraged but not mandatory; it contributes to the score.
### Judging & Fairness
The AI scoring engine will cross-check documentation vs. actual functionality to avoid score inflation.
A human jury will do sanity checks and validate unclear or subjective areas (like UI/UX).
Feedback and appeal for obvious scoring discrepancies will be possible.
### Closing Notes
The hackathon simulates real-world early-stage product ideation, where vague requirements must be shaped into working solutions.
The event emphasizes collaboration, fast delivery, and innovation, not just coding.
While the AI will drive most scoring, human oversight ensures fairness.
 
Appendix
Plan your strategy carefully: each team will receive only a high-level feature—ideation and planning are an essential part of the process.
Live scoring: scoring app will be used, with score updates shared a few times throughout the day.
Showcase your work effectively: each team must prepare a presentation and a short demo video to highlight what was built and the approach taken.
Documentation must be included: documentation must be included in the README file to be considered during evaluation.
Keep it simple: do not include a login screen in your solution, as the application needs to be scored automatically
Task board: The use of a task board will also be part of the scoring.
