Create a clean, intuitive user interface with minimalist aesthetics that prioritizes user experience. 
Use modern typography, strategic white space, and a limited color palette (5-7 colors) to reduce visual clutter. 
Implement responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices. 
Consider micro-interactions that provide subtle feedback and enhance engagement without overwhelming users. Design for accessibility with proper contrast ratios and intuitive navigation. 
Incorporate subtle motion design that guides users' attention. 
If appropriate, explore light glassmorphism effects for depth while maintaining the clean aesthetic. Focus on solving real user problems through intuitive interactions rather than decorative elements
