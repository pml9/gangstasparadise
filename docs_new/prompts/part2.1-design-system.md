**AI Tool Integration:** v0 component generation + UX Pilot optimization + shadcn/ui foundation
**Multi-Tier Support:** Design tokens supporting both polished Tier 1 and mockup Tier 2 features
**Demo Optimization:** Visual hierarchy optimized for 2-minute feature showcase

## Color Palette
**Hackathon Color Strategy:** Limited palette (4-5 colors) optimized for rapid development and feature differentiation

### Primary Colors
Primary Brand - {Hex} (shadcn/ui primary override)
Primary Neutral - {Hex} (Background and clean surfaces)

### Secondary Colors  
Secondary Accent - {Hex} (Feature differentiation and hover states)
Secondary Background - {Hex} (Card backgrounds and subtle highlights)

### Functional Colors (shadcn/ui integrated)
Success - {Hex} (Success states and confirmations - maps to shadcn/ui success)
Warning - {Hex} (Warnings and attention - maps to shadcn/ui warning)  
Error - {Hex} (Errors and destructive actions - maps to shadcn/ui destructive)
Muted - {Hex} (Secondary text and disabled states - maps to shadcn/ui muted)

### Demo-Specific Colors
Tier1 Indicator - {Hex} (Subtle accent for fully-implemented features)
Tier2 Indicator - {Hex} (Subtle accent for mockup features)
Wow Factor - {Hex} (Special accent for impressive AI-enhanced elements)

## Typography (shadcn/ui optimized)
**Font Strategy:** Leverage shadcn/ui typography scale with minimal customization

### Font Family
Primary: var(--font-sans) (shadcn/ui default)
Monospace: var(--font-mono) (For code displays if needed)

### shadcn/ui Typography Scale Integration
**Headings:**
- H1: shadcn/ui "scroll-m-20 text-4xl font-extrabold tracking-tight lg:text-5xl"
- H2: shadcn/ui "scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight first:mt-0"
- H3: shadcn/ui "scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight"

**Body Text:**
- Large: shadcn/ui "text-lg text-muted-foreground"
- Default: shadcn/ui "leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"
- Small: shadcn/ui "text-sm text-muted-foreground"

**Utility Text:**
- Caption: shadcn/ui "text-xs text-muted-foreground"
- Code: shadcn/ui "relative rounded bg-muted px-[0.3rem] py-[0.2rem] font-mono text-sm"

## Component Styling (shadcn/ui foundation)
**Strategy:** 80% shadcn/ui defaults + 20% strategic customization for brand alignment

- sm: space-2 (8px) - Component internal spacing  
- md: space-4 (16px) - Default element spacing
- lg: space-6 (24px) - Section spacing
- xl: space-8 (32px) - Major section separation
- 2xl: space-12 (48px) - Page-level spacing

**Demo-Specific Spacing:**
- Feature Section: space-16 (64px) - Clear feature separation for demo
- Demo Padding: space-8 (32px) - Consistent demo container spacing

## Motion & Animation (Demo-optimized)
**Animation Strategy:** Subtle, professional motion that enhances demo without distraction

**Standard Transitions:**

## Responsive Strategy (Demo-focused)
**Primary Target:** Desktop demo environment (1920x1080 minimum)
**Secondary:** Tablet backup (iPad Pro)
**Tertiary:** Mobile fallback (iPhone 14 Pro)

**Breakpoint Strategy:**
- sm: 640px (Mobile backup)
- md: 768px (Tablet backup)  
- lg: 1024px (Demo environment)
- xl: 1280px+ (Large demo screens)

**shadcn/ui Responsive Patterns:**
