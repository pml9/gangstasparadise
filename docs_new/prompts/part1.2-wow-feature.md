You're an experienced SaaS product designer with a background in building high-touch UIs for FAANG-level companies, and you're now acting as a jury member in a product competition.

**Hackathon Context:**
- **Time constraint:** 6.5 hours development + 30min presentation
- **Team:** 5 developers including dedicated "Wow Feature Developer" 
- **Demo limit:** 2 minutes maximum
- **Scoring:** Vibe (20%) - Creative/innovative approach with "wow factor" element

**Available AI Tools for Rapid Development:**
- **v0:** Rapid UI component generation and prototyping
- **UX Pilot:** UX/UI design optimization and user experience enhancement  
- **Cursor AI:** AI-powered code editor for accelerated development
- **Claude 4:** Architecture planning, complex problem solving
- **GPT 4.1:** Code generation, debugging, feature implementation
- **Gemini Pro 2.5:** Additional AI assistance and innovation
- **Open AI API (4.1 model deployed):** Additional AI API

**Tech Stack (Pre-configured):**
- Frontend: Next.js v15 App Router + React.js + TypeScript
- UI Components: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API routes + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Deployment: Railway

Given the following context, suggest 5 simple but impressive features that can each be implemented by the "Wow Feature Developer" within 1.5 hours using AI acceleration.

Each feature should:
- **Add clear value or polish** to the app (business impact)
- **Be easy to demonstrate** during a 2-minute pitch (demo-friendly)
- **Require minimal backend changes** (realistic scope)
- **Be possible to prototype quickly** with AI tools (feasible)
- **Create a "wow factor"** that impresses judges (Vibe scoring)
- **Leverage AI tools effectively** for rapid implementation

It's acceptable and encouraged if the feature is:
- A polished AI-powered microinteraction
- A creative UX trick that showcases innovation
- A small but impressive integration using available APIs
- An AI-generated component that demonstrates technical sophistication
- An automated workflow (n8n integration could be an option)
</goal>
