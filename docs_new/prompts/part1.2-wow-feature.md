Given the following context, suggest 5 simple but impressive features that can each be implemented by a single developer within 1.5 hours.

Each feature should:

Add clear value or polish to the app
Be easy to demonstrate during a pitch
Require minimal backend changes
Be possible to prototype quickly

It's acceptable if the feature is a UX trick, small integration, or a polished microinteraction
