You are a technical writer tasked with crafting a professional README.md for a hackathon project.
Write a professional README.md file for my hackathon project that will be evaluated on documentation quality. Please structure the README to excel in these judging criteria:

Completeness and clarity of documentation
Clear installation steps and setup instructions
Logical project structure and organization
Explanation of implemented features
Overall professionalism and readability
Inclusion of a technical diagram (preferably as Mermaid.js)

Include these sections:

Project Title & Description - Clear, compelling overview of what the project does and why it matters
Features - Bullet points of key implemented functionality
Technical Architecture - Include a Mermaid.js diagram showing system components and data flow
Installation & Setup - Step-by-step instructions that anyone can follow
Usage - How to run and use the application with examples
Project Structure - Overview of folder/file organization
Technologies Used - Tech stack and key dependencies
API Documentation (if applicable) - Endpoints and usage
Screenshots/Demo - Visual examples of the working application
Challenges & Solutions - Brief discussion of technical hurdles overcome
Future Enhancements - What you'd build next given more time
Team & Acknowledgments - Contributors and credits

Make the tone professional yet engaging, use proper markdown formatting, and ensure everything is scannable with clear headings. The README should demonstrate technical competence while being accessible to both technical and non-technical reviewers.

Write this as a complete, ready-to-use README.md file that showcases the project professionally.

Analyze the project and use the context.
