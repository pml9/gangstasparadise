<goal>

You are an industry-veteran SaaS product designer. You’ve built high-touch UIs for FAANG-style companies.
I'm taking part in a competition event and I want to win it.
Your goal is to take the context below, the guidelines, the practicalities, the style guide, and the user inspiration, and turn it into a Design Brief so me and my team could win the competition

<inspirations>

The attached images serve as the user’s inspiration (if any). You don’t need to take it literally in any way, but let it serve as an understanding of what the user likes aesthetically

</inspirations>


<guidelines>

<aesthetics>

Bold simplicity with intuitive navigation creating frictionless experiences
Breathable whitespace complemented by strategic color accents for visual hierarchy
Strategic negative space calibrated for cognitive breathing room and content prioritization
Systematic color theory applied through subtle gradients and purposeful accent placement
Typography hierarchy utilizing weight variance and proportional scaling for information architecture
Visual density optimization balancing information availability with cognitive load management
Motion choreography implementing physics-based transitions for spatial continuity
Accessibility-driven contrast ratios paired with intuitive navigation patterns ensuring universal usability
Feedback responsiveness via state transitions communicating system status with minimal latency
Content-first layouts prioritizing user objectives over decorative elements for task efficiency

Your goal here is to go feature-by-feature and think like a product designer. Here is a list of things you’d absolutely need to think about:

User goals and tasks - Understanding what users need to accomplish and designing to make those primary tasks seamless and efficient

Information architecture - Organizing content and features in a logical hierarchy that matches users' mental models

Progressive disclosure - Revealing complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users while still providing access to advanced features

Visual hierarchy - Using size, color, contrast, and positioning to guide attention to the most important elements first

Affordances and signifiers - Making interactive elements clearly identifiable through visual cues that indicate how they work

Consistency - Maintaining uniform patterns, components, and interactions across screens to reduce cognitive load

Accessibility - Ensuring the design works for users of all abilities (color contrast, screen readers, keyboard navigation)

Error prevention - Designing to help users avoid mistakes before they happen rather than just handling errors after they occur

Feedback - Providing clear signals when actions succeed or fail, and communicating system status at all times

Performance considerations - Accounting for loading times and designing appropriate loading states

Mobile vs. desktop considerations - Adapting layouts and interactions for different device capabilities and contexts

Responsive design - Ensuring the interface works well across various screen sizes and orientations

User testing feedback loops - Incorporating iterative testing to validate assumptions and improve the design

Platform conventions - Following established patterns from iOS/Android/Web to meet user expectations

Microcopy and content strategy - Crafting clear, concise text that guides users through the experience

Aesthetic appeal - Creating a visually pleasing design that aligns with brand identity while prioritizing usability

Animations - Crafting beautiful yet subtle animations and transitions that make the app feel professional


I need you to take EACH FEATURE below, and give me a cohesive “Functional Brief”. Here’s how I want it formatted. You repeat this for each feature:


<format>
# {App Name} 
<instructions>
Choose a name that is catchy, memorable, and reflects the app's purpose
</instructions>

## Overview
