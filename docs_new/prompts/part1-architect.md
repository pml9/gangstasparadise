You're a Senior Software Engineer with extensive experience designing large-scale web and mobile applications AND winning hackathons. 
I'm competing in a time-boxed hackathon (6.5 hours from requirements to shipping + 30 min presentation prep) and want to win.

Help me brainstorm a **realistic, achievable** project architecture that maximizes our chances of winning by considering:

- **WHAT** I'm building (core value proposition in 1 sentence)
- **WHO** it's for (specific target user/market)  
- **WHY** it matters (problem urgency + market size)
- **HOW** it's different (unique angle/approach that judges will notice)
- **FEASIBILITY** within hackathon timeframe with available team skills

**AI-Enhanced 6.5-Hour Development + 30min Presentation Success Criteria:**
Based on scoring: Feature Coverage (20%), Functionality (20%), Vibe (20%), Documentation (10%), Test Coverage (10%), Project Board (10%), UX/UI (10%)

**With AI acceleration, we can be more ambitious:**

* **Implementation:** Full working feature with AI code generation

### Feature B: [Secondary Feature] 
_Supporting feature that enhances the value proposition_
* Requirement 1 (Complexity: Low) - v0 for UI
* Requirement 2 (Complexity: Low) - Cursor AI for backend
* **Implementation:** Full working feature

### Feature C: [Additional Core Feature]
_Third core feature enabled by AI acceleration_
* AI-generated components and logic
* Rapid prototyping with multiple AI tools
* **Implementation:** Full working feature (AI-enabled ambitious scope)

**Tier 2: Implement Partially (2-3 features with AI assistance for Feature Coverage points)**

### Feature D: [Advanced Feature]
_Show the vision, implement core UI + basic functionality with AI_
* AI-generated UI mockups (working interface)
* Basic functionality demonstration
* **Implementation:** 60-70% complete for demo points (AI-accelerated prototyping)

### Feature E: [Innovation Feature]
_The AI-enhanced "wow factor" feature for Vibe points_
* Creative/unique AI-powered approach
* Combination of AI tools for impressive demonstration
* **Implementation:** AI-generated concept demo + key working AI component

#### Tech Stack (Pre-configured + AI-Enhanced)
* Frontend: Next.js v15 App Router + React.js + TypeScript
* UI Components: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
* Backend: Next.js API routes + TypeScript
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Deployment: Railway
* APIs/Services: [Pre-existing accounts only]

**AI Development Tools:**
* **v0:** Rapid UI component generation and prototyping
* **UX Pilot:** UX/UI design optimization and user experience enhancement
* **Cursor AI:** AI-powered code editor for accelerated development
* **Claude 4:** Architecture planning, documentation, complex problem solving
* **GPT 4.1:** Code generation, debugging, feature implementation
* **Gemini Pro 2.5:** Additional AI assistance for various development tasks

#### Time Allocation (AI-Enhanced 6.5 hours development + 30min presentation)
* **Project setup:** 0 hours (already done)
* **Requirements analysis & AI tool planning:** 0.5 hours
* **Tier 1 features (3-4 full features with AI):** 3.5 hours  
* **Tier 2 features (1-2 partial with AI assistance):** 1.5 hours
* **Strategic testing (backend API tests only):** 0.5 hours (AI-assisted)
* **AI-generated documentation:** 0.25 hours (AI does heavy lifting)
* **AI-enhanced polish & integration:** 0.25 hours
* **Presentation prep:** 30 minutes separate

**AI Acceleration Strategy:**
Build 50-75% more features with same effort by leveraging AI for code generation, UI creation, debugging, and documentation

**Strategic Testing Approach (for 10% Test Coverage points):**
- Focus ONLY on backend API tests (AI can generate these effectively)
- Skip frontend component tests (too time-consuming even with AI)
- Target 2-3 core business logic functions for maximum coverage impact
- Use Jest for API routes, avoid complex React testing scenarios

**Strategic Approach:**
Build for points across ALL scoring categories, not just functionality
